# MU_RPaterson_PasswordGenerator_HW3

## This project is a random password generator

### The user opens the page and is presented with a simple design with one purpose in mind - Generating a password.

### Criteria
â€¢ When they click the 'generate password' button they are presented with prompts to:
1. select password length
2. select whether password has lower case, upper case, numbers, special characters or a combination of any.
3. If the password length is less than 8 characters or more than 128 characters they will be alerted it is an 'invalid length' and will be required to re-enter password length.
4. If the user does not select any character criteria, a password will not be generated and they will be required to re-generate a password, through the process.
5. All character selections they make, will be validated right after with an alert that they have selected that.
6. When all prompts have been answered, a password is generated on the screen in the input field that matches the criteria they selected.
